# Ethernaut Solution
Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired in overthewire.org, to be played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

The game acts both as a tool for those interested in learning ethereum, and as a way to catalogue historical hacks in levels. Levels can be infinite and the game does not require to be played in any particular order.
